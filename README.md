## About Cupra

Cupra (stylized as CUPRA) is a high-performance automotive brand that originated as the performance division of SEAT, a Spanish automobile manufacturer which is part of the Volkswagen Group.

## Generations

- **Origins as SEAT Sport (1985-2018)**: Before becoming an independent brand, Cupra existed as SEAT Sport, the motorsport and high-performance division of SEAT. During this period, they produced performance-oriented versions of SEAT models, badged as "Cupra" (which stood for Cup Racing).

- **Independent Brand (2018-present)**: In 2018, Cupra was officially established as a standalone brand separate from SEAT, though still part of the same corporate structure. This marked a significant shift in strategy, allowing Cupra to develop its own unique identity and expand beyond simply offering performance versions of existing SEAT models. The brand launched with the Cupra Ateca as its first independent model, followed by the Formentor, which was the first vehicle exclusively designed and developed as a Cupra model.

- **Electric Era (2021-present)**: Cupra entered the electric vehicle market with the introduction of the Cupra Born in 2021, based on Volkswagen's MEB platform. This period represents Cupra's expansion into electrified vehicles while maintaining its focus on sporty driving dynamics and distinctive design.
